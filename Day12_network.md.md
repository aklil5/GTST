# Introduction to Netwokring
- a network consists of [two or more] entities or objects sharing resources and information
- a computer network consists of two or more computing devices [connected to each other] to share resources and information
- The network becomes a powerful tool when computers communicate and share resources with other computers on the same network or entirely distinct networks.

- Computers on a network can act as a [client] or a [server]

## Client Computer
- a client is a computer that requests for resources.

## Server Computer
- a server is a computer that controls and provides access to resources.
- But have higher RAM, CPU and STORAGE

# Server Rack
- Switch
- Modem
- Servers
- Firewall
- Display

# Need of Networks
- Enhance communication
- Share resources
- Facilitate centralized management
- Internet


# Classification of Networks
1. Classification by network geography
2. Classification by component roles

# Classification by network geography
- networks are frequently classified according to the geographical boundaries spanned by the network itself.
- LAN, WAN and MAN are the basic types of classification, of which LAN and WAN are frequently used.

## Local area network (LAN)
- A LAN covers a relatively small are such as aa classroom, school or a single building.
- LANs are inexpensive to install and also provide higher speeds.

## Metropolitan area network (MAN)
- A MAN spans the distance of a typical metropolitan city.
- The cost of installation and operation in higher.
- MANs use high-speed connections such as fiber optics to achieve higher speeds.

## Wide area network (WAN)
- WANs span a larger area than a single city.
- These use long distance telecommunication networks for connection, thereby increasing the cost.
- The internet is a good example of a WAN.

# Classification by Component Roles
- Networks can also be classified according to the roles that the networked computers play in the network's operation.
- Peer-to-peer, server-based, and client based are the types of roles into which networks are classified.

## Peer-to-peer
- In a peer-to-peer network, all computers are considered equal.
- each computer controls its own information and is capable of functioning as [either a client or a server] depending upon the requirement.
- Peer-to-peer networks are cheap and easy to install.
- They are popular as home networks and for use in small companies.
- Most Operating systems come with built-in-peer-to-peer networking capability.
- The maximum number of peers that can operate on a peer-to-peer network is [ten].
- Each peer shares resources and allows other open access to them.

## Server based
- A server- based network offers [centralized] control and is designed for secure operations.
- in a server-based network, a dedicated server controls the network.
- a dedicated server is one that services the network by storing data, applications, resources and also provides access to resources required by the client.

## Client-based

# Network Protocol
- Network protocols are the rules and conventions that govern how data is transmitted and received over a network. They define the methods for communication between network devices, ensuring data is properly packaged, transmitted and understood.
- These protocols have their own name and abbreviation.
- Common Network Protocols:
	- HTTPS/HTPPS: Foundation of web browsing, used for transferring web pages.
	- TCP/IP: core protocols for the internet, managing data transmission.
	- FTP: Used for transferring files between computers.
	- DNS: translated domain names into IP addresses.
	- SMTP: Protocol for sending emails.

# Layer 7: Application Layer
- Level at which applications access network services.
	- Represents services that directly support software applications for file transfers, database access and electronic mail, BROWSERS etc.
- Your data is DATA
	- PROTOCOLS: HTTP, FTP, SMTP


# Layer 3:
