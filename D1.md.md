# Git
-  Git is a version control system or tool - 
- simply a tool to manage changes on your files version.
- save the file localy or remote server (github/gitlab) 
- Made by linux devt community

# Github 
- website/server which your git files is hosted on.
- Your files will be stored in folder called "Repository".

## COMMON TERMS OF GIT
- Push - Upload data to remote git server (Github/Gitlab/Gogs)
- Pull - Download some changes(updates maybe) and integrate to the previous local repository
- Clone - download a new repository
- Commit - fundamental operation - saves ur changes to ur repository LOCALLYp0
- Add - staging changes in ur working directory to be included in the next commit.


4 METHODS TO STORE UR NOTES ON GITHUB


```
FOR FIRST TIME
- cd Desktop
- mkdir gtst && cd gtst
- git innit
- git add README.md
- git config --global user.name "ur username"
- git config --global user.email "ur gmail"
- git branch -M main
```

FOR NORMAL WORKS
- git status - current state of files and staging area
	- if all of it is commited it will show - nothing to commit or at first it will show No commit yet
- git add . - "." malet local directory new
- git commit -m "ur comment"
- git log - commit history

FOR GITHUB
- git remote add origin "repositoryURL(from github)" 
	- ketay push saregeh wedezih remote repository new blo menager new
- git push -u origin master
	- it will ask u user name and password which u will find on setting - Developer settings - personal access tokens - tokens - Generate new token (classic)
- git clone "ur project link"
![[Pasted image 20250428174524.png]]

after u set this up for D2 and D3 notes and stuff
- git add . 
- git commit -m ""
- git push -u origin

![[Pasted image 20250428175942.png]]

B) Connect ur VSCODE with ur github
- Setting - Turn on Setting Synx
- open it from the left panel on VS CODE and 
- click on + to stage the commit then 
- add note and click Commit
- then wede github push endidereg click on - Sync Changes 

C) GITHUB WEB
u can create a repo and upload an existing file and commit while on the web

D) GITHUB DESKTOP
when u create a folder on device on github desktop, its already innitialized
- u have to login to ur github acc
- file - accounts - Sign in

if u click of File - Add local repository (already existing one)
			or New Repository


[Obsedian.md

 open a folder as vault and select one that git is innitialized in
 
MarkDown

//

- git is mainly used from the command line which is -  **Terminal on Mac and  PowerShell on windows** 
(commands for the computer to follow)

- all commands run inside a specific FOLDER (the **default** special one is the $HOME(Pc user) folder)

- COMMAND LINES 
	- ls - list the file and folders in the 'current folder'
	- cd ~/Desktop/folder name - change directory ALWAYS (~ = tilda)
	- ls - to check if the directory is changed
	
	SET UP GIT in the folder you want to 
	- git init - sets up git inside the folder, and git is tracking all the file in the folder for changes
	- git status - tells what changes have been made since the previous version
	
	Create a New Version
	1. pick which  changes we want in our next version NOT CREATE a New Version
	- git add file name OR git add folder name
	- git add . - . represents the current folder the command line is running in (which we changed above)- 
	- git status - to check it worked if changes are staged
	- git commit -m "message" - *Version = Commit*
	You just created a new version
	
	If you get a 'fetal' ERROR, git requires you to put in email and name then commit AGAIN
	- git config --global user.email "aklilezewdu@gmail.com"
	- git config --global user.name "Your Name"
	- git commit -m "Version 1"
	- git log - check ur Version History
	
	EDIT A COMMIT/Version
	- git add .
	- git commit -m "Version 1" --amend
	- git log - check version history
	
	Working Area and Staging Area ??
	- git reset  . - OR
	- git reset folder - it will take it out of the staging area
	- git checkout -- file name or . - it will remove all changes


U can Create more Versions with add and commit 
- Go back and View a Previous Version - codum ykeyeral
	- git checkout /commit hash/ - which is the large collection of txt and no next to commit/
	- git log - to check the state of our version history
		- only shows the current commit and those behind it not any infront of it
	- git log --all - shows ALL COMMITS
- 

??????????

BRANKCH is  1 version of the code base
Git BRANCHING and RESTORING a Version
	GOOGLE DOCS VERSION HISTORY

- 1st switch back to 1st version using git checkout commit hash
- HEAD - is the version that we are currently on
- then change sth and add it and create a new commit - 'Version 1 Updated' 
- - if u go back to a previous version, and u start adding new versions on top of it, git history starts braching off of that previous version

- to exit out of this view to this ![[Pasted image 20250425080321.png]]
- how to view the branching effect in ur command line
-IF the Command line is too long and we cant type, write 'q'
- git log --all --graph - shows u the BRANCHING effect
- BRANCH NAME - master or HEAD
- master is used for 
	1. to switch to another checkout - git checkout master /instead of commit hash/
	2. it always points to the LATEST commit in the branch - the one with master is the latest one
- RESTORE VERSION
- git checkout 

// Super simple dev git tutorial





SHORTCUTS
- git config --global alias .s "status"-  where s is the shortcut, and "what it stands for" eg. cm "commit -m" or co "checkout"

IGNORE FILES
- how to ignore certain files from being added to ur version history
	- add a new file called .gitignore 
	- then write down the file names u want ignored inside it eg. secret.txt or /*.txt so that all txt files can be ignored

TO REMOVE GIT FROM PROJECT
- rm -rf .git ???




# GITHUB-DESKTOP

to create new repository 
1. file - new repository
2. Description add some and click on add read me file
3. license- if u choose Mit - alllow ppl to copy and modify ur code
	if u leave it blank - ur project will be licensed with standard copyright


menu bar
![[Pasted image 20250426170637.png]]
other bars
![[Pasted image 20250426170921.png]]

under the repo bar is the main *panel which has a left side bar
![[Pasted image 20250426171054.png]]
it has two tabs
in the changes tab it has *commit panel* at the bottom of side bar
![[Pasted image 20250426171317.png]]

changes and history tabs
Commits panel - at the left bottom
- *Emmet* is powerful toolkit for web developers for fast coding by providing shorthand notation
- *Biolerplate html markup* - ! TAB

After some CHANGE
under the changes tab
- GREEN PLUS Icon - git detected a new file and wants to add it t our repo and track new changes
- blue checked check box - checking the box will STAGE the file - which means u want to include this file change in ur next commit
- 

there is a commit message- describing what the change is - automatically github writes it
u can write a longer description under it on the larger field
![[Pasted image 20250426175421.png]]
after commit to main tab (*current tab*), change tab becomes empty and there will be history tab

after you PUBLISH repository 
in GITHUB

Open ur Repository and the repo
There is 
1. ur user name / the repo - tells u which repo ur in

2. in the MAIN PART
	- u wil lfind the most recent commit message and 
	- it has 6 digit code which is the hash for that specific commit
	- if u click it, it will load that comit and u can see the rly long hash string
	- then is how logn a go the commit was made then at the end is the total number of commits
		Under it is the files in the repo
		- if u open it - it will load the actual code in the file 
		- u can edit and delet it but not recommended
3. 

If there are files u dont want to track in git
- uncheck the blue box
- if you dont want to see it, right click and select ignore file (add to .gitignore)
- and .gitignore file will be created


Push origin
ORIGIN - remote repository that we published on git hub

Another thing git will track of is changes made to existing files
- there is YELLOW Dot Icon - git detected modification in that file
- highlighted in green is code thats been added


Git also tracks if u delete files
- RED minus sibol icon and code highlighted in red - showing it has been removed
- and if u want it back
- go to History - right click and Rever changes in commit - git will create a new commit reverting it.
- u can then push it to origin

BRANCHING
is one version of a codebase and a repo can have multiple branches going at the same time.
each branches will have the most uptodate code from main.
they will then marge it back to the main branch.

To Create Branch
- In the top menu select Branch - new branch 
- u can then add a new file and commit it 
- changes in the new branch are NOT FOUND in the MAIN BRANCH

[MERGE
- Change ur branch to Main 
- go to Branch in top menu - then Merge into current branch and select the branch Other branch
- then click on Create a Merge Commit

[Pull-Request] - new branches merges to the main branch
	allows ppl to check the code and approve before emergin
- make changes and commit
- then push origin without merging
- on GITHUB u would create pull Request


============P2===============
============Intro-to-Cyber-Security===========

- its the practice of protecting systems, networks and programs from digital attacks.
- cyber-attacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing and destroying sensitive info; extorting money from user via ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.
- these cyber attacks are called "Hacking".


# Intro-to-Ethical-hacking
## Hacking
- Exploiting system vulnerabilities and compromising security control to gain unauthorized access to the system.

Ethical hacking - finds the weak points or loophole in a computer web application, or network and reports them to the organization.
The person who perform hacking is called "HACKER"

vuln - quality/state of being exposed to the possibility of being attacked/harmed


# Types-of-Hackers
## Based on ETHICS
1. Black Hat
2. White Hat
3. Grey Hat - who someties act ethically and other times engage in questionable activities

## Based on Skill
1. Newbie/Noob - no knowledge
2. Script Kiddie/S-kids - relatively unskilled individual who uses scripts/programs developed by others, primarily for malicious purposes.
3. Hacker - perfectly skilled, with less experience
4. Elite/Pro Hacker - Perfectly skilled, with much more experience

## why we learn cyber sec
- prevent hackers from gaining access
- uncover vuln
- strengthen organization
- safeguard data
- avoid security breaches
- enhance security awareness


# Elements-of-information-security
cyber attack is when one or more of these elements is compromised

CIA triad

1. **Confidentiality**: / misterawinet/ - info is safe from accidental or intentional disclosure. 

	efforts of organization to make sure data is kept secret/private.
	access to info must be controlled to prevent the unauthorized sharing data - whether intentional or accidental.


2. **Integrity**: /tamagnenet/ - safe from accidental or intentional modification or alteration.

	make sure your data is trustworth and free from tampering/change.
	integrity of your data is maintained only if the data is authetic, accurage, and reliable.
	attack on financial transactions to alter records.


3.  **Availability**: /tegegninet/ - the information is available to authorized users when needed.

	information resources are accessible when you need them.
	causing website downtime. 



# Phases-of-Hacking
1. Reconnaissance
Gathering information about the target through passive and active means (eg. scanning, OSINT - open source intelligence)

2. Scanning
Identify open ports, services and vulnerabilities using Hacking tools.

3. Gaining Access
Exploiting vulnerabilities to access the target system.

4. Maintaining Access
Establishing backdoors or persistence for continuous access.

5. Clearing Tracks or Logs
Erasing logs and hiding any signs of intrusion.


# Penetration-Testing
method of evaluating the security of an information system or network by simulating an attack to:
- find vulnerability
- security measures
- documentation and report preparation

Why we need Penetration Testing
- identification of threats
- security protections and controls
- assessment of organization's security
- evaluation of network security
- upgradation of infrastructure

Types of Pentesting
1. Black Box Pentesting
	testing system without prior knowledge.
	you test as an attacker.

2. White Box Pentesting
	testing system with prior knowledge.
	you test an a developer.

3. Grey Box Pentesting
	testing system with limited knowledge.
	you test as a user.


Cyber Security Field Terms
- Red Teaming/Offensive Security/
	simulating real-world attacks to test an organization's security posture.
- Blue Teaming/Defensive Security/
	defending against attacks and improving security controls.
	monitors systems, analyzes network traffic, and responds to potential threats.
- Security Audit
	comprehensive evaluation of an organization's information systems, security controls and procedures.
	assesses compliance with security standards, policies, and regulatory requirements.
- vulnerability Assessment
	identifies and classifies security flaws in systems, networks and software.
	involves automated scanning, manual testing, and analysis to highlight weaknesses - using TOOLS.
